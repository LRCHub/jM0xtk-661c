Dark noise sounding
Black surrounding
Distance ringing
Try to reach me
Sleeping on the floor
The lines are breaking
Light spills from under the door
Wake me if you can
Tie it back in place
I'll wait for you to see
A tunnel out of the night
Channeling into another time
Wake me if you can
The lines are breaking
I'll wait for you to see
